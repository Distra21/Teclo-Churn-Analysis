# Telco-Churn-Analysis
Project Overview: Turning Churn Data into Strategic Advantage

This project addresses a critical challenge faced by a Telco business: a high customer churn rate of 26.5%, leading to substantial revenue loss. The core objective is to shift from reactive customer retention to a "precision retention" model through data-driven strategies.

Key aspects of the project include:

1. Problem Identification: The project clearly defines the churn challenge, quantifying the financial impact of lost customers (average lifetime value of $2,280 per customer).

2. Root Cause Analysis: Through a deep dive into enriched datasets, the project identifies specific friction points contributing to churn:

    - High churn among month-to-month subscribers (42%).

    - Significant churn among fiber-optic customers (42%), suggesting service quality or ROI issues.

    - Elevated churn among electronic-check payers (46%), indicating payment friction.

    - Customer dissatisfaction due to inefficient support (long resolution times, low first-contact resolution).

3. Data-Driven Solutions (Retention Playbook): Based on these insights, a multi-pronged strategy is proposed:

    - Targeted Contract Incentives: Offering upgrades to high-risk month-to-month customers.

    - Service Quality Assurance for Fiber: Proactive network monitoring and service-level guarantees.

    - Payment Modernization Campaign: Incentivizing electronic payment enrollment.

    - Support Process Optimization: Implementing a "Resolve-First" task force to improve first-contact resolution and reduce average resolution time.

4. Expected Strategic Impact: The project anticipates significant benefits:

    - Revenue Stabilization: Reducing churn by just 5 percentage points is projected to recoup substantial annualized revenue.

    - Operational Efficiency: Improved support processes will lead to reduced costs and higher customer satisfaction.

    - Predictive Precision: Enhanced churn prediction models for earlier, more effective interventions.

5. Immediate Actions: The plan includes concrete next steps such as launching campaigns, deploying a real-time retention dashboard, and establishing "Health Score" alerts for at-risk accounts.

In essence, the project is about leveraging data to understand why customers leave, implementing targeted interventions, and continuously monitoring performance to secure customer loyalty and drive sustainable growth.
